Reimplement simple NN in python

# Reimplementing a simple neural network is a good to way to learn DL
- In my other project applying BERT model to text classification, I struggled with modifying other people's PyTorch code to my purpose. Although I understood generally what the different components did, my struggle impelled me to gain a deeper understanding of PyTorch. And there’s no better way to do that than reimplementing some of PyTorch’s basic functionalities from the ground up. This is also giving me a deeper understanding of deep learning fundamentals.    
- This is part of my notes from the fast.ai course (part 2), where I reimplemented some of PyTorch’s functionalities in their barest forms. I often learn by looking at other people’s code, and hopefully this can help other DL beginners to start playing with their models.
